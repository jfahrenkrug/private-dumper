Private Dumper is a tool to simplify the use of class-dump to create header files from all private iOS frameworks so you can use them in your app (yes, yes, I know you can't put them on the AppStore then).

Usage: 
ruby private-dumper <iOS SDK version> <path to headers output directory>

Please provide both the iOS SDK version you want to dump (for example 4.2) and the path to the output directory.
Example: ruby private-dumper.rb 4.2 ~/Headers
